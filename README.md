### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- If you don't have one, open an account with [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)
- The CLI of Fly.io, `flyctl.` See the [installation guide](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/)
- Node.js v20.x
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

## Quick Startâ€”"Hello World" in 5 Minutes or Less

Once the prerequisites are completed and `flyctl` CLI tool is installed:

1. **Clone the repository**

   - Clone the Repository using the
     [GitHub template](https://github.com/new?template_name=styleguide-remix-template&template_owner=Kurocado-Studio).
     Note that GitHub will clone the template using `Initial commit,` the initial build will fail on
     the [Linting](https://kurocado.youtrack.cloud/articles/PLA-A-5/Lint) pipeline due to
     `Initial commit` going against [conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/)
     enforced by [CommitLint config](https://kurocado.youtrack.cloud/articles/STY-A-12/CommitLint)
   - Install dependencies. We use `pnpm,` you can install pnpm if you don't have it already
     [here](https://pnpm.io/)

2. **While on the `main` branch, rename the repository**

   - Change the `styleguide-remix-template` to the application's name
     - on [package.json](./package.json)
     - on [fly.toml](./fly.toml)

3. **Commit changes**

   - Commit changes following [conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) or amend the
     `Initial commit` message via
     [git commit --amend](https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History)
     - Quick Example: `refactor(config): initial config setup`

4. **Launch your application**

   - Run `fly launch` from inside your project source directory to configure the new application.

5. Push your changes

   - ðŸŽ‰ You're Ready to Go! You've successfully set up your TypeScript project and can now take
     advantage of all the automation and tooling that Kurocado Studio provides. If you have any
     questions or need support, feel free to check out the documentation or reach out to the
     Kurocado Studio team.

## Have a JetBrains IDE?

Use the [Documentation](https://kurocado.youtrack.cloud/articles/PLA-A-7/Document) pipeline via
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) using
[Writerside Jetbrains Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20158-writerside)

- Go to Repository Settings
  - Navigate to your GitHub repository.
  - Click on the **Settings** tab.
- **Enable GitHub Pages**
  - Scroll down to the **Pages** section in the left sidebar.
  - Under **Build and deployment**, select **GitHub Actions** as the source.
- Add the workflow to the main `ci.yaml` file, here is an example:

  ```yaml
  # rest of config

  permissions:
  contents: write
  pages: write
  id-token: write

  jobs:
    # other jobs placeholder

    document:
      uses: kurocado-studio/dev-ops/.github/workflows/workflow.document.yml@main
      secrets: inherit

    # other jobs placeholder
  ```

- This will enable the [Documentation](https://kurocado.youtrack.cloud/articles/PLA-A-7/Document)
  pipeline
